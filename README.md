This project is dedicated to translation from German to English translation. It was not allowed to use pre-trained weights for the models, 
ensembles and more data, so the final results (they are in the file "test1.de-en.en") have BLEU score just 24.41, but the highest baseline on this task has 
BLEU score 27, to this project's results are relatively high.
